## Description

The Spreadsheet Library is designed to read and write Spreadsheet Documents.
As of version 0.6.0, only Microsoft Excel compatible spreadsheets are
supported. Spreadsheet is a combination/complete rewrite of the
Spreadsheet::Excel Library by Daniel J. Berger and the ParseExcel Library by
Hannes Wyss. Spreadsheet can read, write and modify Spreadsheet Documents.

## Notes from Users

Alfred: a@boxbot.org: I think it should be noted in the README file that the library doesn't
recognize cell formats in Excel created documents, which results in
Floats returned for any number.

## What's new?

* Supported outline (grouping) functions
* Significantly improved memory-efficiency when reading large Excel Files
* Limited Spreadsheet modification support
* Improved handling of String Encodings


## On the Roadmap

* Improved Format support/Styles
* Document Modification: Formats/Styles
* Formula Support
* Document Modification: Formulas
* Write-Support: BIFF5
* Remove backward compatibility code

Note: Spreadsheet supports Ruby 1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.9.3, 2.0.0, 2.1.1, 2.2.2

You will get a deprecated warning about iconv when using spreadsheet with Ruby
1.9.3. So replacing iconv is on the Roadmap as well ;).

## Dependencies

* [ruby-ole](http://code.google.com/p/ruby-ole/)


## Examples

* Have a look at the [GUIDE](https://github.com/zdavatz/spreadsheet/blob/master/GUIDE.md)

## Installation

Using [RubyGems](http://www.rubygems.org):

* `sudo gem install spreadsheet`

If you don't like [RubyGems](http://www.rubygems.org), let me know which
installation solution you prefer and I'll include it in the future.

If you can use 'rake' and 'hoe' library is also installed, you can 
build a gem package as follows:

* `gem build spreadsheet.gemspec`

The gem package is built in pkg directory.

## Testing

Bundler support added.
